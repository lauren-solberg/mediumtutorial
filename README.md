 If not, don’t worry about it. Just write a brief summary of your project and make sure to save your file.


 STEPS:
 1. go to github and create a new repository.
        On the home page of your GitHub dashboard, click the green button that says “New” to create a new repository, or “repo.” Your repo is where you will store versions of your code for this particular project. You’ll need a new repo for each project that you begin.
 2. back in VSCode, click on Terminal > New Terminal
        Terminal commands to learn:
            git init = 
                git initialize (this allows your project to use version control)
            dir = 
                directory (in this context, directory means folder)
            mkdir (folder name)= 
                make directory called (folder name)
            cd = 
                change directory. Use cd (folder name) to enter a folder, and cd .. to go back to the parent folder of the one you’re currently in
            ls = 
                list (this will will list all the files/folders that are inside your current folder)
